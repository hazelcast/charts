# Hazelcast

[Hazelcast IMDG](http://hazelcast.com/) is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when it’s needed for optimal performance.

## Quick Start

    $ helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
    $ helm repo update
    $ helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast

For users who already added `hazelcast` repo to their local helm client before; you need to run `helm repo add` command again to use latest charts at the new chart repo:

    $ helm repo list
    NAME            URL
    hazelcast       https://hazelcast.github.io/charts/
    ...

    $ helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/

    $ helm repo list
    NAME            URL
    hazelcast       https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
    ...

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/tree/master/hazelcast-kubernetes) and [Management Center](https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center-docker) deployments on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

-   Kubernetes 1.9+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

    $ helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast

The command deploys Hazelcast on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

    $ helm delete my-release

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Hazelcast chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value,key=value` argument to `helm install`. For example,

    $ helm install my-release \
    --set cluster.memberCount=3 \
        hazelcast/hazelcast

The above command sets number of Hazelcast members to 3.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

    $ helm install my-release -f values.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast

> **Tip**: You can use the default values.yaml

## Custom Hazelcast configuration

Custom Hazelcast configuration can be specified inside `values.yaml`, as the `hazelcast.yaml` property.

    hazelcast:
       yaml:
        hazelcast:
          network:
            join:
              multicast:
                enabled: false
              kubernetes:
                enabled: true
                service-name: ${serviceName}
                namespace: ${namespace}
                resolve-not-ready-addresses: true
            <!-- Custom Configuration Placeholder -->

## Adding custom JAR files to the IMDG/Management Center classpath

You can mount any volume which contains your JAR files to the pods created by helm chart using `customVolume` configuration.

When the `customVolume` set, it will mount provided volume to the pod on `/data/custom` path. This path is also appended to the classpath of running Java process.

For example, if you have existing [Local Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/04/04/kubernetes-1.14-local-persistent-volumes-ga/) and Persistent Volume Claims like below;

```yaml
  kind: StorageClass
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: local-storage
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: <hz-custom-local-pv / mc-custom-local-pv>
  spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    capacity:
      storage: 1Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    local:
      path: </path/to/your/jars>
    nodeAffinity:
      required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - <YOUR_NODE>
  ---

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: < hz-custom-local-pv-claim / mc-custom-local-pv-claim>
  spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

You can configure your Helm chart to use it like below in your `values.yaml` file.

For IMDG:
```yaml
customVolume:
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: hz-custom-local-pv-claim
```

For Management Center:
```yaml
mancenter:

# Notable changes

## 2.8.0

Hazelcast REST Endpoints are no longer enabled by default and the parameter `hazelcast.rest` is no longer available. If you want to enable REST, please add the related `endpoint-groups` to the Hazelcast Configuration. For example:

    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_READ:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_WRITE:
          enabled: true
