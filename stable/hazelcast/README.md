# Hazelcast

[Hazelcast IMDG](http://hazelcast.com/) is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when itâ€™s needed for optimal performance.

## Quick Start

    $ helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
    $ helm repo update
    $ helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast

For users who already added `hazelcast` repo to their local helm client before; you need to run `helm repo add` command again to use latest charts at the new chart repo:

    $ helm repo list
    NAME            URL
    hazelcast       https://hazelcast.github.io/charts/
    ...

    $ helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/

    $ helm repo list
    NAME            URL
    hazelcast       https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
    ...

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/tree/master/hazelcast-kubernetes) and [Management Center](https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center-docker) deployments on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

-   Kubernetes 1.9+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

    $ helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast

The command deploys Hazelcast on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

    $ helm delete my-release

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Hazelcast chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value,key=value` argument to `helm install`. For example,

    $ helm install my-release \
    --set cluster.memberCount=3 \
        hazelcast/hazelcast

The above command sets number of Hazelcast members to 3.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

    $ helm install my-release -f values.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast

> **Tip**: You can use the default values.yaml

## Custom Hazelcast configuration

Custom Hazelcast configuration can be specified inside `values.yaml`, as the `hazelcast.yaml` property.

    hazelcast:
       yaml:
        hazelcast:
          network:
            join:
              multicast:
                enabled: false
              kubernetes:
                enabled: true
                service-name: ${serviceName}
                namespace: ${namespace}
                resolve-not-ready-addresses: true
            <!-- Custom Configuration Placeholder -->

## Adding custom JAR files to the IMDG/Management Center classpath

You can mount any volume which contains your JAR files to the pods created by helm chart using `customVolume` configuration.

When the `customVolume` set, it will mount provided volume to the pod on `/data/custom` path. This path is also appended to the classpath of running Java process.

For example, if you have existing [Local Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/04/04/kubernetes-1.14-local-persistent-volumes-ga/) and Persistent Volume Claims like below;

```yaml
  kind: StorageClass
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: local-storage
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: <hz-custom-local-pv / mc-custom-local-pv>
  spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    capacity:
      storage: 1Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    local:
      path: </path/to/your/jars>
    nodeAffinity:
      required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - <YOUR_NODE>
  ---

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: < hz-custom-local-pv-claim / mc-custom-local-pv-claim>
  spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

You can configure your Helm chart to use it like below in your `values.yaml` file.

For IMDG:
```yaml
customVolume:
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: hz-custom-local-pv-claim
```

For Management Center:
```yaml
mancenter:
  ...
  customVolume:
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mc-custom-local-pv-claim
```

# Notable changes

## 2.8.0

Hazelcast REST Endpoints are no longer enabled by default and the parameter `hazelcast.rest` is no longer available. If you want to enable REST, please add the related `endpoint-groups` to the Hazelcast Configuration. For example:

    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_READ:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_WRITE:
          enabled: true
