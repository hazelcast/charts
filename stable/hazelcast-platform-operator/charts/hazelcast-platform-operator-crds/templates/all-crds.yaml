                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less

                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,

                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                          description: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes
                            that have a label with this key and identical values are
                            considered to be in the same topology. We consider each
                            <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular
                            instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain
                            as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                            and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                            each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                            is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain
                            of that topology. It's a required field.

                          description: 'WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with
                            a pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint. -
                            DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule
                            it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the
                            pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies
                            that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered
                            "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every
                            possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew"
                            on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew
                            is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread
                            as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming
                            pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2)
                            as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1).
                            In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but
                            scheduler won''t make it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required
                            field.'
